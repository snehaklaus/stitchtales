## Overview

StitchTales is a Django-based blog application designed around community-driven content. Authors can register, manage their profiles, write and publish posts with cover images, and interact with other creators through comments and likes. The platform is deployed on Railway with media files stored on Supabase Storage.

### User Authentication & Profiles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Supabase account with a storage bucket created
- PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for local dev)

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sneh1117/stitchtales.git
cd stitchtales

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Create a .env file (see Environment Variables section)

# 5. Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# 6. Create a superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# 7. Start the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```env
# Django
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost

# Database (leave as default for SQLite locally)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3

# Supabase Storage
USE_SUPABASE=True
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_BUCKET=media

# CSRF (production only)
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.up.railway.app
```

> **Important:** Use the **service role key** from Supabase (Settings → API), not the anon key. The service role key is required for server-side file uploads.
